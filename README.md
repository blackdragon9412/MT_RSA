# RSA Encryption 

This repository contains a simple implementation of RSA encryption in C#. The program demonstrates the following:
- Modular Exponentiation for encryption.
- Encoding a string input into Unicode values.
- Encrypting the Unicode values using RSA public key encryption.
- Converting the encrypted numbers into Base64 encoded strings for readable output.
